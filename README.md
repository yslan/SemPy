This is the code for my final project of CS556

The original code is copied from 
https://github.com/SealUofI/SemPy



### drivers:
- `example_fix.py`: minimum efforts to make the example runnable.
   only do up to (single) non-deformed element, but the main operators consoder deformed geometry

- `ref2d_v1.py`: clean up, revisit all functions, start to use mine version under (`my_sem/`)
   - D-N BCs, E=1, non-deformed
   - cg, pcg (mass, jacobi, fdm)

### dev notes:
